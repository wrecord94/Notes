# Oracle SQL: Ownership, `CURRENT_SCHEMA`, and `@DBLINK_RW` Explained

## üîê Schema Owners in Oracle

- In Oracle, a **schema owner** is a user who owns database objects (tables, views, etc.).
- Example: If user `HR` creates a table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE employees (...);
  ```
  The full reference would be `HR.EMPLOYEES`.

- If another user wants to access it, they must either:
  - Reference it fully: `SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES;`
  - Use a synonym
  - Or set the session schema (see below)

## ‚öôÔ∏è `ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA = XXX`

### What it does:
- Temporarily changes the **default schema** for the session.
- Lets you run:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES;
  ```
  Instead of:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM XXX.EMPLOYEES;
  ```

### Why it's useful:
- Simplifies code
- Avoids hardcoding schema names
- Doesn‚Äôt require reconnecting as another user

### Notes:
- Does **not** change your actual user or privileges.
- You still need proper permissions on the objects in the target schema.

## üåâ Understanding `@DBLINK_RW`

### What is `@DBLINK_RW`?
- `DBLINK_RW` is the **name of a database link**, not a schema or table.
- It connects your database to a **remote Oracle database**.

### How it works:
Given:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE LINK DBLINK_RW
  CONNECT TO remote_user IDENTIFIED BY password
  USING 'remote_tns';
```

Then running:
```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES@DBLINK_RW;
```

Means:
- Oracle connects to the remote DB as `remote_user`
- Executes: `SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES` **in that remote schema**

### To query a different schema remotely:
```sql
SELECT * FROM other_schema.table_name@DBLINK_RW;
```

| Concept                  | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Schema owner             | User who owns a DB object (e.g., `HR.EMPLOYEES`)                        |
| `CURRENT_SCHEMA`         | Temporarily changes default schema in your session                      |
| `@DBLINK_RW`             | A named connection to a remote Oracle database                          |
| Remote user access       | Based on credentials in `CREATE DATABASE LINK`                          |
| Accessing remote schemas | Use `schema.table@dblink` or remote synonyms                            |

## ‚úÖ Tips

- Use `ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA` to simplify scripts when switching schemas.
- Use DB links for cross-database queries, but be aware of permissions and user contexts.
- Check DB link metadata using:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM USER_DB_LINKS;
  ```
