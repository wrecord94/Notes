# üêç Python Cheat Sheet (Days 11-20)

# Day 11: Capstone project

# Day 12: Scope

## What is Scope?
Scope defines where a variable can be accessed in your code:  
- **Local Scope:** Variables defined inside a function are only accessible within that function.  
- **Global Scope:** Variables defined outside functions are accessible everywhere.

## Local vs Global Scope
Variables inside a function are local and can't be accessed outside.  Whereas variables defined at the top level are global and can be used anywhere.

**Example:**  
```python
y = 20  # Global variable
def my_function():
    x = 10  # Local variable
    print(x)
my_function()
# print(x)  # Error: x is not accessible outside
```

## Modifying Global Variables
Use the `global` keyword to modify a global variable inside a function.  
**Example:**  
```python
count = 0
def increment():
    global count
    count += 1
increment()
print(count)  # Output: 1
```
If we don't do this and try to modify within a function this won't actually doesn't modify it, but instead creates a brand new variable locally.

# Global variables
Some things in our code we want to always stay the same for example; PI, or our Instagram handle. We always use capitals as a reminder when we are using them in functions etc that it‚Äôs a reminder it‚Äôs a global variable.

```python
PI = 3.14159265359
URL = 'https://www.etc.com'
INSTAGRAM_HANDLE = "@DALEDENTZ04"
```

## Name Resolution (LEGB Rule)
Python follows the LEGB rule to find variables:  
- **L**ocal: Inside the function.  
- **E**nclosing: In outer functions (for nested functions).  
- **G**lobal: At the top level.  
- **B**uilt-in: Python‚Äôs built-in names (e.g., `print`).

# Day 16: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is OOP?
OOP models real-world objects in code, unlike procedural programming, which can become complex and hard to manage. OOP organizes code into reusable, modular units called **objects**, making it easier to understand, iterate, and maintain.

### Key Concepts
- **Classes:** Blueprints for creating objects, defining their attributes (what they have) and methods (what they do).
- **Objects:** Instances of a class, representing real-world entities (e.g., a car or bike).
- **Attributes:** Properties of an object (e.g., a bike‚Äôs name or gear).
- **Methods:** Functions inside a class that define an object‚Äôs behavior (e.g., changing gears).

### Benefits
- **Reusability:** Create multiple objects with variations (e.g., a sporty car or luxury car from the same car class).
- **Modularity:** Encapsulate data and behavior, reducing complexity.

## Creating a Class
Use the `class` keyword with **PascalCase** for class names (e.g., `BikeClass`).

## Constructors
The task of constructors is to initialize (assign values) to the members of the class when an object of the class is created.

**Note: to Self** `self` represents the instance of class. Whilst not technically a keyword it allows you to access variables, attributes, and methods of a defined class in Python


### Example: Bike Class
```python
class Bike:
    def __init__(self):  # Constructor to initialize attributes
        self.name = ""   # Attribute: name
        self.gear = 0    # Attribute: gear

    def change_gear(self, direction):  # Method to change gear
        if direction == "up":
            self.gear += 1
        elif direction == "down":
            self.gear -= 1
        else:
            print("Invalid direction. Choose 'up' or 'down'.")
```

### Creating and Using an Object
```python
# Create an object (instance of Bike class)
bike1 = Bike()

# Access and modify attributes
bike1.name = "Mountain Bike"
print(bike1.name)  # Output: Mountain Bike
print(bike1.gear)  # Output: 0

# Call a method
bike1.change_gear("up")
print(bike1.gear)  # Output: 1
```

# Day 18: Tuples

## Creating a Tuple
Tuples are created using parentheses `()` with elements separated by commas. Parentheses are optional but recommended.  
**Examples:**  
- Empty tuple: `my_tuple = ()`  
- Mixed types: `my_tuple = (1, 2, "Hello", 3.4)`  
- Nested tuple: `my_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))`

## Accessing Tuple Elements
Use indexing with `[]` to access elements. Indices start at 0.  
**Example:**  
```python
my_tuple = ('a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e')
print(my_tuple.count('p'))  # Output: 2
print(my_tuple.index('l'))  # Output: 3
```
**Note:** Accessing an index beyond the tuple‚Äôs range (e.g., 6 in a 5-element tuple) raises an `IndexError`.

## Tuple Methods
Tuples are immutable, so methods to add/remove elements don‚Äôt exist. Only two methods are available:  
- `count(x)`: Counts occurrences of `x` in the tuple.  
- `index(x)`: Returns the first index of `x`.

## Advantages of Tuples Over Lists
- **Use Case:** Use tuples for heterogeneous data (mixed types) and lists for homogeneous data (same type).  
- **Immutability:** Tuples can‚Äôt be changed, making them "write-protected" and usable as dictionary keys (unlike lists).  
- **Performance:** Iterating over a tuple is slightly faster than a list.  
- **Conversion:** Convert a tuple to a list using `list(my_tuple)` if modifications are needed.

# Day 19: Instances, State and Higher Order Functions

## Higher-Order Functions
A **higher-order function** takes other functions as arguments or returns a function. This enables flexible, reusable code by passing functions as arguments to define different behaviors.

### Example: Calculator Operations
```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def apply_operation(func, x, y):
    return func(x, y)

result1 = apply_operation(add, 3, 4)      # Output: 7
result2 = apply_operation(multiply, 3, 4) # Output: 12
print(result1)
print(result2)
```
Here, `apply_operation` is a higher-order function that takes `add` or `multiply` as an argument.

## When Are Higher-Order Functions Useful?
They‚Äôre useful for event-driven programming, where a function is triggered by specific events (e.g., a key press).  
**Example:**  
```python
screen.listen()
screen.onkey(key="space", fun=move_forwards)
```
- `onkey` is a higher-order function that binds the `move_forwards` function to the "space" key press.
- Use keyword arguments (e.g., `key`, `fun`) for clarity, avoiding positional arguments.
Object States and instances

## Object States and Instances

**Instances** are when we create mutliple versions of a class blueprint these different versions are called **instances**.

**States** refer to objects of the same class with different attributes or performing different methods at the same time. They could also have different states i.e. in the middle of a method call versus stationary.
