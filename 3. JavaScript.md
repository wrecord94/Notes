# 🚀 An Introduction to JavaScript

### 🏷️ Naming
- Initially called **LiveScript** but due to Java's popularity at the time, JavaScript was positioned as a “younger brother” of Java.
- JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called **ECMAScript**, and now it has no relation to Java at all. 🔗❌

### 🌍 How and where can it be executed?
- JavaScript can execute in the **browser**, on the **server**, or any device that has a program called the **JavaScript engine**. 💻📲
- The **browser** has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”. 🌐⚙️
- Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:
  - 🏎️ **V8** – in Chrome, Opera, and Edge.
  - 🦊 **SpiderMonkey** – in Firefox.
  - 🔵 **Chakra** – for Internet Explorer.
  - 🍏 **JavaScriptCore**, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish”🐠 – for Safari.

### 🛠️ Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy.
- The **engine** (embedded if it’s a browser) **parses** the script. 📜🔍
- Then converts (“compiles”) the script to **machine code** which then runs. ⚡💾
- The engine applies **optimizations** at each step of the process. It even **watches** the compiled script as it runs, **analyzes** the data that flows through it, and further **optimizes** the machine code based on that knowledge. 🚀📊

### ❓ What makes JavaScript unique? 🤔

- Full integration with HTML/CSS.
- Simple things are done simply.
- Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.
- JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.
- It’s the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces but can also be used to create servers, mobile applications, etc.
