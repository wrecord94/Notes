# An Introduction to JavaScript

### Naming
- Initially called LiveScript” but due to Java's popularity at the time JavaScript was positioned as a “younger brother” of Java.
- JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.

### How and where can it be executed?
- JavaScript can execute in the browser, on the server, or any device that has a program called the JavaScript engine.
- The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.
- Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:
  - V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
  - SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.
  - “Chakra” for IE
  - “JavaScriptCore”, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.

### Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy.
- The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) parses the script.
- Then converts (“compiles”) the script to machine code which then runs.
- The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code based on that knowledge.

### What makes JavaScript unique?

- Full integration with HTML/CSS.
- Simple things are done simply.
- Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.
- JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.
- It’s the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces but can also be used to create servers, mobile applications, etc.
